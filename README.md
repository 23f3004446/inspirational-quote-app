## 📝 Brief (Round 1)

The objective for this application was:
> Create a **beautiful and colorful** inspirational quote generator. The page must have a **vibrant, animated gradient background**. The content should be centered in a **stylish card** with soft shadows and rounded corners. Use a clean, elegant font from Google Fonts (like Poppins or Lato). There must be a button labeled `New Quote` that fetches a new quote from a pre-defined JavaScript array and displays it with a **subtle fade-in animation**.

## 🚀 Deployment

The live application is deployed using GitHub Pages.
